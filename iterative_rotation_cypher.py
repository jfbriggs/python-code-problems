"""
To complete the task, you will create an object with two methods, encode and decode.

Input:
The encode method will receive two arguments — a positive integer n and a string value.
The decode method will receive one argument — a string value.

Output:
Each method will return a string value.

How It Works:
Encoding and decoding are done by performing a series of character and substring rotations on a string input.

Encoding: The number of rotations is determined by the value of n. The sequence of rotations is applied in the following order:
 Step 1: remove all spaces in the string (but remember their positions)
 Step 2: shift the order of characters in the new string to the right by n characters
 Step 3: put the spaces back in their original positions
 Step 4: shift the characters of each substring (separated by one or more consecutive spaces) to the right by n
Repeat this process until it has been completed n times in total.
The value n is then prepended to the resulting string with a space.

Decoding: Decoding simply reverses the encoding process.
