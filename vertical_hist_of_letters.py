"""
You are given a string s. Your task is to count the number of each letter (A-Z), and make a vertical histogram as result.
Look at the following examples to understand the rules.

Example:

For s = "XXY YY ZZZ123ZZZ AAA BB C", the output should be:

          *
          *
          *
*       * *
* *   * * *
* * * * * *
A B C X Y Z

- Rules

- You just need to count the uppercase letters. Any other character will be ignored.
- Using * to represent the number of characters.
- The order of output is form A to Z. Characters that do not appear in the string are ignored.
- To beautify the histogram, there is a space between every pair of columns.
- There are no extra spaces at the end of each row. Also, use "\n" to separate rows.
